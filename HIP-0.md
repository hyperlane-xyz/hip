### **Brief Summary / Abstract**

< Explain in plain language the TL;DR of the specification. This section should be human-readable and as concise as possible without omitting the core of the spec. >

### **Tech Spec**

< Describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. >

### **Rationale**

< Dig into the design decisions that were made, and what motivations are at play. If applicable, list alternate designs that were given serious consideration. A complete rationale should raise important objections or concerns surfaced during HIP discussion. >

### **Backwards Compatibility**

< If applicable, discuss any backwards-incompatibilities and their consequences. Suggest a plan for dealing with these incompatibilities. >

### **Security Considerations**

< Include information that might be important for security discussions. Surface risks and challenges that accompany the specification, and propose a plan for addressing such risks either during Draft or Review phase. >
