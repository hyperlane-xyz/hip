| 2   | Validator signatures | Draft  | asaj   | 2022-12-20 |

### **Brief Summary / Abstract**

Defines the specification for Hyperlane validator signatures.

Hyperlane validators sign messages that act as attestations of the form:

> "On chain _d_, the mailbox contract at address _m_ had a messages tree with merkle root _r_ and message count _i_"

### **Motivation**

Hyperlane validators provide the foundation for two core interchain security modules types: Multisig, and Optimistic.

This HIP defines a standard for validator signatures so that they can be shared across different security module instances.

### **Tech Spec**

A Hyperlane validator should sign the following, in compliance with [EIP-191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191).

```
/**
 * @notice Returns the digest that Hyperlane validators should sign
 * @param _domain The origin domain of the Mailbox being validated
 * @param _mailbox The address of the Mailbox being validated, as bytes32
 * @param _root The merkle root that the validator is attesting to
 * @param _index The message count that the validator is attesting to
 * @return The digest to EIP-191 sign
 */
function getDigestToSign(
    uint32 _domain,
    bytes32 _mailbox,
    bytes32 _root,
    uint32 _index
)
    external
    pure
    returns (bytes32)
{

    bytes32 _domainHash = keccak256(
        abi.encodePacked(_domain, _mailbox, "HYPERLANE")
    );
    return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_domainHash, _root, _index));
}
```

A `ValidatorSignatureVerifier` contract implementing the following interface should be deployed to each chain supporting Hyperlane. This contract must implement the following interface and emit the `ValidatorSignature` event when verifying a signature.

Verifying signatures via `ValidatorSignatureVerifier` allows watchers to more easily monitor for fraudulent validator signatures.

```
interface IValidatorSignatureVerifier {
    /**
     * @notice Emitted when a validator signature is verified
     * @dev Used by watchtowers to detect fraudulent validators
     * @param domain The origin domain of the Mailbox being validated
     * @param mailbox The address of the Mailbox being validated, as bytes32
     * @param root The merkle root that the validator is attesting to
     * @param index The message count that the validator is attesting to
     * @param signature The 65-byte ECDSA validator signature
     */
    event ValidatorSignature(
        uint32 domain,
        bytes32 mailbox,
        bytes32 root,
        uint32 index
        bytes signature
    );

    /**
     * @param _domain The origin domain of the Mailbox being validated
     * @param _mailbox The address of the Mailbox being validated, as bytes32
     * @param _root The merkle root that the validator is attesting to
     * @param _index The message count that the validator is attesting to
     * @param _signature The 65-byte ECDSA validator signature
     * @return The address of the validator that signed
     */
    function recoverValidatorFromSignature(
        uint32 _domain,
        bytes32 _mailbox,
        bytes32 _root,
        uint32 _index,
        bytes calldata _signature
    ) external returns (address);
}
```

### **Rationale**

#### Inclusion of origin mailbox address

Requires ISMs to verify this! Kind of a pain!

#### Encouraging verification through ValidatorSignatureVerifier

While less gas efficient, this ensures that there is a single contract that watchers can monitor for fraudulent validator signatures.

Fraudulent validator signatures may be used to slash the fraudulent validator, or as a trigger to disconnect an optimistic ISM.

Encouraging a single implementation also reduces the risk that validator-signature-based ISM implementers introduce bugs in signature verification.

### **Backwards Compatibility**

This format is not backwards compatible with V1, which is actually a good thing as it means validator signatures cannot be re-used.

The default MultisigIsm in the V2 pre-release does not use a `ValidatorSignatureVerifier`. This can be corrected in future ISM deployements.

### **Security Considerations**

A bug in `ValidatorSignatureVerifier` would risk compromising all validator-signature-based ISMs.
